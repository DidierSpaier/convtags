# Configuration
# =============
# 
# We provide no configuration file. To create one, just type:
#   convtags config > [configuration file]
# then edit your configuration file to customize the settings.
# 
# To use your configuration file, set it as CONFIGFILE in the command
# line, for instance:
#   CONFIGFILE=~/convtagsrc convtags ...
#
# CONFIGFILE is set to a null string by default.
#
CONFIGFILE=${CONFIGFILE:-}
#
# DKROOT is the absolute URL of the DokuWiki remote server.
# Setting it allows you to replace the internal links in a DokuWiki page
# by corresponding external links in the converted AsciiDoc page, thus
# allowing to check them.
# When converting back to DokuWiki the absolute URLs are kept.
#
DKROOT=${DKROOT:-http://docs.slackware.com}
#
# DKIMAGES is the absolute URL of the images' sub-directory of the
# DokuWiki installation.
# Setting it allows you to display in the converted AsciiDoc page the
# images linked as internal in the DokuWiki pages, and optionally to
# keep the full URL of the images in the converted back DokuWiki pages.
#
DKIMAGES=${DKIMAGES:-http://docs.slackware.com/_media}
#
# KEEPIMG is a switch (yes/no) to indicate if the external URL of the
# images stored on the DokuWiki installation should be be kept (if yes) or
# stripped (if no) from the links to these images in the pages converted
# back to DokuWiki.
# Intended usage:
# _Choose yes to check the layout of the converted back DokuWiki page
#  locally (before transfering it to the remote DokuWiki server).
# _Choose no to transfer the converted page to the remote Dokuwiki server.
#
KEEPIMAGES=${KEEPIMAGES:-yes}
#
# ICONSDIR is the directory that gathers the icons in the local Asciidoc
# installation.
#

#
# Rationale
# =========
#
# sed is basically a line editor, that has limited abilities to process a
# block of consecutive lines, partly because a POSIX compliant sed program
# is not required to be able to store more than 8192 bytes in the pattern
# and hold spaces.
#
# But the proper processing instructions of a line depends on its context
# set by the previous line(s).
#
# To hand over this context from a line to the next one(s), we store it at
# the end of each cycle in the hold space, represented by a character
# string that we call the "baton" by analogy with a relay race, separated
# from the input data by a U+04 or  character.
#
# At the beginning of each cycle we append the baton to the new input line
# gathered in the pattern space.
#
# U+04 represents the last hex digits of the Unicode code point of
# <end of text> in UTF-8.
#
# Here is the list of the control codes and other indicators used,
# represented in the same way.
#
# Char.  Corresponding mark or meaning
# 01  begins a <code> ... </code> block
# 02  begins a <file> ... </file> block
# 03  begins a <nowiki> ... </nowiki> area
# 04  Separates the baton from the input data
# 05  begins a preformatted block
# 06  list item that can continue on the next line
# 07  %% preceding the text not to be parsed (as <nowiki>)
# 08   %% following the text not to be parsed (as </nowiki>)
# 0E   ends a <code>... or <file>... block or of a code block whose
#         lines begin with two spaces
# 10  ends a <nowiki> ... </nowiki>
# 11  %% in case of an odd number of this pattern in a line
# 12  Local tentative replacement
# 12  Local tentative replacement
# 14  indicates a blank line so we know that the previous was blank
# 15  separator, replaced by a zero width space U+200B at end of script
# 16  marks the beginning of the remaining part of the line where we
#         still have to look for "no formatting" areas.
# 1A  begins a <note[^<]*> ... </note> area
# 1C   tentatively replaces /^  / in a preformatted block.
# We have to deal with DokuWiki' syntax, that:
# _allows to put the opening or closing tag of a block anywhere on a line
# _has several ways of marking the beginning and the end of a code block
#  and "no formatting" area
# _requests a specific usage of the "forced line break" and location of
#  opening and closing tags of a code block to indicate that the next
#  line(s) should be indented as part of a list item, cf.
#  https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq:lists
#
# We will standardize the formatting of the Code blocks, recording in the
# baton the initial kind when it opens to allow finding the corresponding
# closing tag or line.
#
# Similarly we will standardize the formatting of the "no formatting" areas
# remembering the opening tag's kind in the baton.
#
# In this first part, we put each opening or closing tag of a block of text
# on its own line, to ease further processing, somehow "verticalizing" the
# input text.
#
# Initialization
# ==============
# Append an empty baton to the first input line
1 s/$//
# Append the baton, gathered from the hold space, to following input lines.
2,$	{
		G
		s/\n//
}
# If the baton included a  or a  or a  indicator, move
# it at the beginning of the pattern space so we know that we are in a
# delimited  block.

# Lists
# =====
# We know that we are not in the Code block if no ,  or  begins
# the pattern space. If after two spaces we see a "*" or a "-' this is a
# list item, not the beginning of a preformatted block.
#
# Dokuwki detects a list item even with an odd number of leading spaces,
# and no space between the last * or - and the text. The patterns are
# adapted accordingly. 
# We need to cope with differences between DokuWiki and AsciiDoc:
# _ In AsciiDoc, a list item is only recognized as such if preceded by an
#   empty line or by a "line continuation" \n+\n indicator (and there can
#   be any number of empty  lines between two list items). Else the line
#   that begins with "*" is  just appended to the previous one.
# _ In DokuWiki an empty line ends a list, then the next list item will
#   be of level 1 regardless of the number of spaces before "*" or "-"
#

#
# Code blocks
# ===========
#
# Here "code block"  designate a block surrounded by <code ...> then
# </code> or by <file ...> then </file>: they have the same syntax in
# DokuWiki. We will convert these blocks in "literal blocks" in
# Asciidoc parlance.
#
# In DokuWiki syntax a code block that begins inside a line belonging to
# a list item is embedded in this list item.
# But in AsciiDoc a literal block shall begin and end with marks alone
# on their lines, and for such a block to be embedded in a list item that
# immediately precedes it these marks should be surrounded by lines
# including just a <plus> sign.
# So, as // indicates a list item:
# _ If //! we need a newline before and after <code[^>]*> and
#   </code> if they are not the first or the last word of the line resp.
# _ If // we need a line with just a <plus> before <code[^>]*>
#   and after <plus> and <code[^>]*> if they are not the first or the
#   last word respectively (a <code> that begins a line is not in a list
#   item)
#
# We process the tags only if they have not a  "Code block begins"
# indicator on their left, not followed by a "Code block ends" indicator.
# We insert a "Code block begins" indicator after the <code> tag only if
# this tag doesn't end the line as else the indicator in the baton suffice.
# We remove all spaces after </code>
# <code> ... </code> blocks
# We skip the <code> tags if preceded by %% or </nowiki>, not followed
# by another %% or </nowiki>
# <code> begins a Code block, but in a delimited block.
# 
# We wil convert separately the beginning of blocks with a "to be
# highlighted" source code.
#
# We perform here the first part of the conversion, that is isolate each
# tag on a line, the opening tag being preceded by a line with
# [source,<language>] in case of syntax highlighting.
# The replacement of the tags by lines containing just"----" will be made
# in the second part of the program.
#
# First if we have a pattern /^   */ we are in a preformatted block
# (not in a list, that would have been detected above). Then, skip the
# processing of code blocks.

# Preformatted text ?
# ===================
#
# Let's find the beginning of preformatted blocks of text.
# An input line beginning with two spaces and that is not in a list item
# nor part of a Code block begins a preformatted block.
# But if this input line contains no graphical character, then it begins
# such a block only if one of the following adjacent lines also begins with
# two spaces and includes a graphical character.
#
# To check that, in case the first line of the "could be" preformatted block
# contains only spaces, we fetch the next lines until we find a line that
# either does not begin with two spaces, or includes a graphical
# character in POSIX parlance.
# _If the line contains at least two spaces and nothing else, we fetch the
#  next line.
# _If the line does not begin with two spaces we begin a new cycle without
#  fetching a new input line: we didn not begin a preformatted block.
# _Else the line begins with two spaces and includes at least one graphical
#  character. Then we mark the line as preformatted and branch to the label
#  "preformat" that begins the processing of preformatted blocks.
# In all cases we remove the previous line after having fetched a new one.
#
# We insert an empty line before ^<code>, as a workaround against an
# AsciiDoc bug that wrongly converts e.g.
#
# ----
# Literal block 1
# ----
# <line of text>
# ----
# Literal block 2
# ----
# 
# in cases where <line of text> is very short like "to".

# Tables
# ======
# In DokuWiki a table cell begins with "^" (to be formatted as a heading)
# or "|" (default formatting) and ends with one or more consecutive
# "|" or "^". The number of trailing "|" or "^" indicates the number of
# columns that the cell on their left spans on its right, for instance ^^^
# means that the cell spans over three columns and that the one to the
# right on the same row (if any) should be formatted as a heading. 
# Here is an example of DokuWiki formatting of table cells, followed by
# its conversion to AsciiDoc syntax.
# ^  This right aligned heading spans over 3 columns on its right|||
# 3+>h|This right aligned heading span over 3 columns on its right|
# The kind (| or ^) of the rightmost cell boundary in a row doesn't matter
# and in AsciiDoc the rightmost cell doesn't have a right boundary in "psv"
# (the default) table format.
# ^ will be converted to "h" as in "heading"
# | will not be converted (it is the default)
# > means align right, ^ align center, < align left 
# ^^^ becomes 3+
# We won't convert vertical (over rows) spanning: that would need to store
# the whole table in the pattern and/or hold space as the DokuWiki ":::"
# mark found alone in a cell indicates that it should span over the cell
# up, but in AsciiDoc the mark ".<number>" indicates that the cell spans
# over <number> cells down, so we would need to read and store <number>
# lines before making the conversion.
# We will make the conversion in following order:
# horizontal spanning, then alignment (>, ^ or <), then formatting (h or d)
