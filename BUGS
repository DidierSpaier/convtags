Bugs and issues in the conversion from DokuWiki to AsciiDoc
-----------------------------------------------------------

This document has been last updated on 14/10/2015.


After a forced line break, in AsciiDoc the alignment set for an image is
not respected, i.e. align="center" doesn't produce the intended behavior.

Workaraound: instead of using a forced line break. insert an empty line 
before the image link.

--

More generally, avoid using forced line breaks unless necessary, mainly
to indicate the continuation of a list item.

--

If a line intended to be a list item (beginning with "  *" for instance)
is predeced by a line beginning with "  " (at least two spaces)  it will be
converted as a Code block instead.

Workaround: remove all spaces in a line otherwise empty in the DokuWiki file,
unless it really begins a Code block.

-- 

Some characters need to be escaped. As a result some lines in the converted
AsciiDoc page can be borked. This is the case for instance of:
http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:general_admin:cli_constructs_and_useful_info

Involved characters are not properky converted (there may be others):
Character or pattern  Issue with AsciiDoc
^text^                renders "text" as superscript 
*some text*           renders "some text" in bold
{<name>}              interpreted as {<attribute>}. If <attribute> does
                      not exist the line is deleted.

I don't know a general workaround.

--
 
List items that embed a Code block at once (instead of after a "\n+\n"
indicating that the list item continues) are not well rendered in AsciiDoc.

Workaraound: in DokuWiki, put the opening <code> or <file> tag at end of
line (but ths change the visual appearance in DokuWiki).

--

Images are rendered as block elements in Asciidoc, not inline. This can
change the layout, i.e. lines that iclude a small images are cut.

Similarly, if a line includes three images (left, center, right) only two
of them are aligned in the converted AsciiDoc document.

But including the images as inline elements instead of as block elements in
AsciiDoc has other draw backs, hence this choice.
